                  Based on Joint Work with Ronen Nir, Alexander Tuisov, Alexander Shleyfman, and Moshe Tennenholz. <br/>
                  <b>Abstract:</b> Agents operating in a multi-agent environment must consider not just their own actions, but also those of the other agents in the system. Artificial social systems are <span id="dots1">...</span> <span id="more1">a well known means for coordinating a set of agents, without requiring centralized planning or online negotiation between agents. Artificial social systems enact a social law which restricts the agents from performing some actions under some circumstances. A good social law prevents the agents from interfering with each other, but does not prevent them from achieving their goals. However, designing good social laws, or even checking whether a proposed social law is good, are hard questions. 
We present approaches for verifying whether a given social law is robust under different planning formalisms, as well as techniques for automatically synthesizing a robust social law.<br/>

                  <b>Title:</b> <i>Hierarchical and decentralized planning for multi-robot deployment in harsh communication environments</i> <br/>
                  <b>Abstract:</b> The automated deployment of multiple robots in outdoor environments is challenging, because it needs first to plan for robot activities in order to fulfill a mission, <span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2">and second, to make the robot team able to overcome unexpected situations in real-time. In outdoor fields, like in disaster response or surveillance missions, the communication infrastructure may be damaged or just limited. This communication limits require the deployment of specific algorithms and architectures, in order to compute a multi-robot mission plan and adapt this plan at execution. In this talk, the algorithms and architecture deployed for a multi-robot surveillance mission will be presented. Hybrid planning -- that mixes hierarchical planning and partial-order planning -- has been used to plan robot activities, leading to a temporally flexible plan for each robot, with joint communication tasks. During execution, a distributed plan adaptation approach has been developed to manage temporal flexibility, and a decentralized repair protocol has been applied when having to adapt to more complex situations.<br/>

## Aim

<p align="justify">
Autonomous agents is a well-established area that has been researched for decades, both from a design and implementation viewpoint.  Nonetheless, the application of agents in real world scenarios is largely adopted when logical distribution is needed, while still limited when physical distribution is necessary.
In parallel, robots are no longer used only in industrial applications, but are instead being applied to an increasing number of domains, ranging from robotic assistants to search and rescue. Robots in these applications often benefit from (or require) some level (semi or full) of autonomy. Thus, multi-agent solutions can be exploited in robotic scenarios, considering their strong similarity both in terms of logical distribution and interaction among autonomous entities.<br>
<br>
The autonomous behaviour responsible for decision-making should (ideally) be verifiable since these systems are expensive to produce and are often deployed in safety-critical situations. Thus, verification and validation are important and necessary steps towards providing assurances about the reliability of autonomy in these systems.
This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the autonomous agents, software engineering and the robotics communities, as combining knowledge coming from these two research areas may lead to innovative approaches that solve complex problems related with the verification and validation of autonomous robotic systems. Consequently, we encourage submissions that combine agents, robots, and verification, but we also welcome papers focused on one of these areas, as long as their applicability to the other areas is clear.
